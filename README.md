# What is this?
This is my flink cdc practice. I was considering to use flink for my data pipeline.  
In my case I have a couple of requirements for the pipeline
- Near realtime data sync from various source
- Data sink destination is S3 storage with suitable big data table system/format but not Hive(Apache Iceberg or Apache HUDI are what I'm looking for)
